# run

This is a convenience command for building a `.kya` program and then executing it. With the current implementation, it blocks for all output produced by the program before displaying it. If you want to run a program without blocking, use the `build` command and run the compiled binary directly.

For a more detailed explanation, see the help command: `kyanite help`
