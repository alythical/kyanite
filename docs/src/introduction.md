# Introduction

> Languages are cool! Compilers are cool! How do they work? That's why this project exists: Kyanite is a statically-typed, compiled programming language to learn more about how PLs are created. There are two backends: LLVM and a custom IR, kyir. The latter currently supports more language features, but is much less stable than the former.

Welcome to the Kyanite docs! See the sidebar for an overview of what's here, particularly the [language reference](./ref/index.md).
